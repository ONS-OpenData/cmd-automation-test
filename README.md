# cmd-automation-test

Testing whether the upload process of data in Florence can be automated.

CPIH is the data that is being tested.

The idea is that running main.py will trigger the transform to run and then upload that data into Florence using the API's.

Before running
- Make sure the source data is in this repo
- Source data includes the previous v4
- Update florence-details.json with your email and password
